# Analyzing the Impact of Knowledge Graph Hubs on Language Model Retrieval Quality

## 📌 Overview

This project investigates how **hub nodes in knowledge graphs** influence the **retrieval quality in language model-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems**. We explore whether the structural centrality of entities in a knowledge graph affects their likelihood of being retrieved and used in downstream QA tasks.

The goal is to systematically analyze hub influence, develop hub-aware retrieval strategies, and propose adjustments to improve RAG method for QA benchmarks.
